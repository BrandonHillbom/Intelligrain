# Intelligrain
A mobile app for farmers that leverages Ground Truth Agriculture's real-time computer vision technology to assess the quality of grain as it is being harvested. This will allow farmers to see an accurate depiction of their crop, enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions and enhance crop yields.

# Project background/Business Opportunity
Ground Truth Agriculture has recently created computer vision technology that scans grain as it is harvested in real-time to determine the characteristics of the crop. By having an accurate understanding of their crop, a farmer can make optimal market decisions and shape agronomic practices. This is a first-of-a-kind technology that is capable of scanning grain in bulk as soon as it is harvested. However, the application that farmers will use to access this information has not yet been developed. This is where we come in. We intend to provide a solution to farmers that allows them to view combines and their progress during harvest as well as receive real-time data on crop grades and sample oddities.

Growing up in Saskatchewan, we are very cognizant of the impact farmers have on our food production and economic growth. They are a major part of our community and we believe we must support them in achieving optimal yields. We are aiming to provide solutions towards the United Nations Sustainable Goals: zero hunger, decent work and economic growth, and industry, innovation, and infrastructure.

Please note our code is unavaliable as it is private to Ground Truth Ag.
